# Origins-LXL
Origins mod for LiteXLoader


# Why?
Because Origins+ add-on lowers your TPS and affects player.json
# Is it a full copy of Origins mod?
No, it is impossible to port all of the features from mod to server-side script
# Will you port it to loader-name?
Maybe, if it has as much features as LXL and supports JS
# Is it compatible with add-on-name?
It should be so, but I can't test it with any add-on existing
# Can I download it right now?
Sadly, no. Script's development has just started, it's too early to show you anything
