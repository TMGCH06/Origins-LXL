# Origins-LXL
Origins mod for LiteXLoader


# How to use?
Just put "plugins" and "origins" folders into your BDS root folder. [LiteXLoader](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteXLoader "LiteXLoader") is required!
# What is done
- [x] Form UI with all origins from original mod
- [x] Writing player's origin to json file 
- [ ] Configuration file
- [ ] Origins' abilities
- [ ] Language configs
- [ ] Ability to add custom origins using json
- [ ] Code cleanup
# Why?
Because Origins+ add-on lowers your TPS and affects player.json
# Is it a full copy of Origins mod?
No, it is impossible to port all of the features from mod to server-side script
# Will you port it to loader-name?
Maybe, if it has as much features as LXL and supports JS
# Is it compatible with add-on-name?
It should be so, but I can't test it with any add-on existing
# Is the script ready to use?
Sadly, no. Script's development has just started, but you can contribute
